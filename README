Slate Star Redux

This is a layout experiment on top of the original Slate Star Codex blog.
A modern, static rework focused on readability and clean CSS.

Built with Astro.  
No interactivity yet â€” just content and structure.

Planned:
- Reader settings with Svelte + CSS variables (text size, margins, color scheme, line-height, etc.) stored in local storage.
- Lightweight interactivity without compromising performance. Site will be always performant, clean, responsive, and minimal.
